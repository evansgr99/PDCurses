
This video helped me understand how to compile this.

I already have mingw-64 

Step 1) run the makefile:
mingw32-make -f makefile

This will compile everything, and 'pdcurses.a' is the library (similar to a .lib file)

Step 2) get the library and paste it, along with curses.h, wherever you want!

Step 3 - optional) create a c file such as main.c, include curses.h, and build it with:
gcc main.c -o main.exe pdcurses.a
