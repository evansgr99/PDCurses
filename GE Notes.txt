
This video helped me understand how to compile this.

I already have mingw-64, and use that for the makefile.



Step 0) read the top of the Makefile, which has some notes
- need to set top line to 'o', run the makefile below, then change it to 'obj', then re-run make
- this is because zig creates .obj files instead of .o files for some reason


Step 1) run the makefile:
mingw32-make -f Makefile DLL=Y WIDE=Y UTF8=Y 

This will compile everything, and 'pdcurses.a' is the library (similar to a .lib file)

# Usage: make [-f path\Makefile] [DEBUG=Y] [DLL=Y] [WIDE=Y] [UTF8=Y] [INFOEX=N] [tgt]
#
# where tgt can be any of:  [all|demos|pdcurses.a|testcurs.exe...]



Step 2) get the library and paste it, along with curses.h, wherever you want!

Step 3 - optional) create a c file such as main.c, include curses.h, and build it with:
mingw-64:        gcc main.c -o main.exe pdcurses.a
zig version:  zig cc main.c -o main.exe pdcurses.a
