
This video helped me understand how to compile this.

I already have mingw-64 

Step 1) run the makefile:
mingw32-make -f makefile

This will compile everything, and 'pdcurses.a' is the library (similar to a .lib file)


Step1b) alternate versions:
mingw32-make -f Makefile DLL=Y WIDE=Y UTF8=Y    # GE: add '--verbose' if problems



# Usage: make [-f path\Makefile] [DEBUG=Y] [DLL=Y] [WIDE=Y] [UTF8=Y] [INFOEX=N] [tgt]
#
# where tgt can be any of:  [all|demos|pdcurses.a|testcurs.exe...]



Step 2) get the library and paste it, along with curses.h, wherever you want!

Step 3 - optional) create a c file such as main.c, include curses.h, and build it with:
mingw-64:        gcc main.c -o main.exe pdcurses.a
zig version:  zig cc main.c -o main.exe pdcurses.a
